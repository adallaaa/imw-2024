        <b class="jetbrain">A website is like a ball rolling down a unlit stairwell. The stairwells ending is unknown
            and each step that
            the ball bounces on can represent a different stage of the website, where does the ball stop? Will it stop?
            What will you find at the end? Do you stop the ball or does it stop on it's own? The steps you take
            exploring your website will inevitably reflect on you as a person, and sometimes yo decide your done and
            stop it's creation then and there, and sometimes you'll let the ball roll to the end.</b>
